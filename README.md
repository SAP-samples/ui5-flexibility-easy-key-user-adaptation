## Description
This hands-on tutorial dives into the world of UI adaptation, providing tools and techniques to enhance SAPUI5 applications.

You'll learn how to enable your own Fiori elements application for SAPUI5 flexibility, understanding the process from start to finish. Then, you'll deploy the app to a BTP ABAP environment in a trial system. Next, you'll discover how to adapt your custom application without writing a single line of code. This tutorial guides you through key user adaptation features, including popular standard features like moving, adding, and removing UI elements (fields, sections, etc.), as well as renaming them. You'll also explore the latest complex changes made easy, such as modifying manifest properties and OData annotations, all while staying no-code.
